# Verify Face

## Overview

Verify Face is a facial recognition project designed to authenticate and verify individuals' identities using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The project processes facial images, compares them against a database of known faces, and determines whether a match exists. It is built using technologies such as Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.

Vface is now running on windows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/).
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) (if applicable).
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Configure the project:
   ```sh
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cmake --build build
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```sh
   python server/main.py
   ```

2. Use the application to upload and verify facial images.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Identify and verify individuals using facial images.
- **Database Integration**: Store and retrieve facial data for comparison.
- **Server API**: Expose endpoints for client applications to interact with the system.
- **Image Processing**: Preprocess and analyze images for optimal recognition accuracy.
